# The-Logic-Game
This logic game helps philosophy students learn the truth table definitions of logical operators. I plan to create a similar game for boolean algebra in the near future. I also have a more complex version with an about page, log-in features, and user information storage in a MySQL database. Message me if you'd like more information.
