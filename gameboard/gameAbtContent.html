            One of the most challenging parts of learning propositional logic is getting a firm grasp on the truth table definitions of the operators. The Logic Game is a fun way to learn these operators. The operators are defined as follows for sentences p and q:

                Now that we know the truth table definitions of the operators, let's look at how to play. One player will play for True, and one player will play for false. Each players goal for winning the game is to make the &#8801; operator at the bottom of the board come out T if you are playing for True, and F if you are playing for false. The computer randomely assigns the initial truth values at the top of the gameboard. The True player goes first. Select one of the first three dropdown menus from from the gameboard, and choose a logical operator. This counts as a turn. After a choice, that position on the board becomes fixed, since the truth value of that position on the board is determined by the truth values that "point to" that position on the board, and the logical operator that is chosen for that position. After all the positions on a row of the game board become fixed, the next row of positions becomes available. You may alter the truth value at a position by clicking the tilde beside that position. However, you can only click on tildes after the position associated with that tilde becomes fixed, but before the positions below become fixed. A few practice games should make the rules clearer and more intuitive.
